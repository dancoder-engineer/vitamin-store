# Online Vitamin Store

What we have here is an online vitamin store that uses Google Pay, and has a number of items in its inventory.

## Installation

In order to install, you need to first install dependencies for the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

And then the backend

```bash
cd backend
bundle install
```

## Usage

First load up the backend or the frontend will have nothing to read:

```bash
cd backend
rails s
```

Then you can open a new terminal and do

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## User Journey
The health conscious user can shop around, since carts don't need you to be logged in, and persist between logins and logouts, even between different users as long as the cookie stays. They can even write reviews of the items - a must for any website that seeks to carry different brands.
